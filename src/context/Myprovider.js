  <p>We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Collecting and processing your personal information</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, Secure Privacy is a Data
    Controller of your personal information. Our legal basis for collecting
    and using your personal information, as described in this Privacy
    Policy, depends on the information we collect and the specific context
    in which we collect it. We may process your personal information
    because:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We need to perform a contract with you, such as when you create a
      Policy with us
    </li>
    <li>You have given us permission to do so</li>
    <li>
      The processing is in our legitimate interests and it's not overridden
      by your rights
    </li>
    <li>For payment processing purposes</li>
    <li>To comply with the law</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We may also collect personal information that you give us during your
    communication with us regarding our services, such as technical support
    threads. In addition to the above, we may need to use your personal
    information for audits and compliance with our legal obligations under
    applicable law.
