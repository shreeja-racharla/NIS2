Finally, a decision should be made as to how the implementation of the security requirements can be appropriately verified. For this purpose, adequate verification processes and procedures should be defined according to the respective risk (and the associated protection needs). Their purpose is to ensure that contractors implement the necessary requirements.\n\nEstablishment in standard processes:\nThe insights gained should be used to develop a comprehensible procedure and to integrate it into the existing processes of the B2B / supplier management. This starts with the selection of the contractor, where aspects of information security should already be taken into account alongside criteria such as quality, adherence to delivery dates, credit rating etc. The procurement process should be such that the relevance of information security has already been taken into account beforehand (with respect to the procurement decision; contract design; inspection requirements).\nFurthermore, it is recommended to incorporate information security aspects into existing processes for supplier evaluation which have already been established by e.g. an existing quality management system.\nContractually specified deliverables (e.g. availability requirements) should be verified at regular intervals.
